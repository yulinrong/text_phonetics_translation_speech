# text_phonetics_translation_speech
A program that generates phonetics, translation and speech for text.

1. You should put your english text in a file named data.txt.
2. You can run the program by
```bash
python Learn_english.py data.txt
```
3. You can download the Learn_english.exe and run it on window. **Note that** you'd better start exe from the command line to avoid flash back. You also need to provide a data.txt which should be placed under the same folder with Learn_english.exe.

## Example of data.txt:
